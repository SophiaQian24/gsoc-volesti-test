# Gsoc-Counting linear extensions with volume computation and applications in AI

## Tasks
### Easy: 
Download, compile and run a simple volume estimation example with both C++ and R interfaces of volesti.

### Medium: 
Reproduce this issue and comment on possible explanations and solutions.

### Hard: 
Write in your proposal how the implementation of the exact Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with Gaussian target distribution in [10, 11] can be optimized for an order polytope.
